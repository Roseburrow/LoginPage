# Login Page Task

This task was created using create-react-app. Once you have this repo on your machine run `npm install` to ensure you have the packages it requires.

The application can be started by running `npm start`. In order to change the language go to the config.js file in **src/languages/** and change the `CURRENT_LANGUAGE` parameter to:

* `fr` for french
* `en` for english
*  `pirate` for pirate

You can also change the default language here if you want to.
